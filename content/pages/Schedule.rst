Notes
-----
**Lab talks -** Group leaders/lab representatives/important people speak 
about a theme interest. Ideally their talk will be related to an idea/
problem they wish to work on over the following day. Some groups may not 
want to talk and I may have missed some people. Please do not hesitate to let 
me know/submit a pull request.


**Survey results -** See the survey page. This will help shape the symposium. 
It may be of merit to have this before the lab talks...


**Someone important talks -** Depends on availability. Ideally they focus on 
Lab ---> clinic research. Importance of communication/collaboration etc. 


**Explain the format, Pitches, Voting, Team forming & planning -** As 
discussed previously. Those whom spoke earlier (and any others interested) 
are invited to convince others why they should work with them tomorrow on 
a problem/idea/plan. Pitch is for 60 seconds. 


**Wednesday -** Work all day (& night if you're keen) on the problem/idea/
plan in the team you picked. Groups do not need to be coding focused. For 
example - develop Microbial Genomics teaching resources, literature reviews,
skills transfer (intro to digital research skills/tools) etc. Ideally group 
leaders act as mentors and move around the groups listening to what the 
groups are working on and adding help/insight etc.


**Check ins -** How each team is going. Problems? What they need help with. 


**Thursday -** For each team, a 5 minute (+ 5 minute Q&A) report on the progress, 
results, outcomes and future.
