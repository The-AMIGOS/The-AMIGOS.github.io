Notes
-----
**Lab talks (Tuesday afternoon)-** Group leaders or lab representative speak 
about a theme of interest. Includes a brief overview of their lab/research. 
The rest of their talk will be related to an idea/problem in microbial 
bioinformatics that they wish to work on over the following day. Some groups 
may not want to talk and I may have missed some people. Please do not 
hesitate to let me know/submit a pull request.


**Survey results -** See the survey page. This will help shape the symposium. 
It may be of merit to have this before the lab talks. The results will be 
distributed to Group leaders or lab representatives by Monday midday. 


**Overview talk (invited) -** Will depend on availability. Ideally the 
focus on is on a theme like  Lab --> clinic. Emphasises the importance of 
communication and collaboration.  


**Explain the format, Pitches, Voting & Team forming & planning -** Those 
whom spoke earlier (and any others interested) are invited to convince others 
why they should work with them tomorrow on a problem/idea/plan. Pitch is for 
60 seconds (verbal delivery only, no slides etc).


**Wednesday -** Work all day (and night if you're keen) on the problem/idea/
plan in the team you picked. Groups do not need to be coding focused. For 
example - develop Microbial Genomics teaching resources, literature reviews,
skills transfer (intro to digital research skills/tools) etc. Ideally group 
leaders act as mentors and move around the groups listening to what the 
groups are working on and adding help/insight etc.


**Check ins -** How each team is going. Problems? What they need help with. 


**Thursday -** For each team, a 5 minute (+ 5 minute Q&A) report on the progress, 
results, outcomes and future.
